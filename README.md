# minicom-tutorial-for-network-system-admin
Minicom is a terminal emulator program that is commonly used by network administrators to configure and manage network devices such as routers, switches, and servers.

**Here are some ways in which network administrators use minicom:**
- Accessing the command-line interface (CLI) of network devices: Minicom can be used to connect to the CLI of a network device through a console cable, allowing network administrators to enter commands and configure the device.

- Troubleshooting network issues: Minicom can be used to remotely access a network device and view system logs, error messages, and other diagnostic information that can be used to troubleshoot network issues.

- Upgrading firmware: Network administrators can use minicom to upload new firmware to a device and perform firmware upgrades.

- Saving and restoring configuration: Minicom can be used to save the current configuration of a network device to a file, and then restore that configuration to the device at a later time.

- Automating tasks: Network administrators can use minicom in combination with scripting languages such as Python or Bash to automate repetitive tasks, such as configuring multiple devices with the same settings.

_Note: Minicom is just one tool among many that Network administrator can use, and it might not be the best or the only option depending on the device or the task at hand._
